## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add and manage employee records  
- ✅ Support for Full-Time and Part-Time employees  
- ✅ Salary calculation based on employee type  
- ✅ Demonstrates Java OOP principles:  
  - **Encapsulation** – Private fields with getters/setters  
  - **Inheritance** – Subclasses extend base class  
  - **Polymorphism** – Method overriding for salary calculation  
  - **Abstraction** – Shared behavior via common structure  
- ✅ Clean console interface with structured code

## 📂 Classes

- **Employee.java** – Base class with common attributes  
- **FullTimeEmployee.java** – Inherits `Employee`, includes fixed salary logic  
- **PartTimeEmployee.java** – Inherits `Employee`, handles hourly pay logic  
- **PayrollSystem.java** – Manages employee records and calculates salary  
- **Main.java** – Entry point of the application
