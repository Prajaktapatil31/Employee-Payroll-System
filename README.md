Ever wondered how payroll works behind the scenes? 🧐 This Java OOPS project unveils a simple yet powerful Employee Payroll System, built with rock-solid OOP principles! 💪📈💰 Get ready to dive into clean code! 🚀

✨ Features

* **Employee Management:** Add and manage different types of employees (Full-Time and Part-Time).
* **Payroll Calculation:** Calculate the payroll for each employee based on their type and specific attributes (salary for full-time, hourly rate and hours worked for part-time).
* **OOP Principles:** Implements key OOP concepts such as:
    * **Encapsulation:** Data and methods are bundled within classes (e.g., `Employee`, `FullTimeEmployee`, `PartTimeEmployee`).
    * **Inheritance:** `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` inherit from the `Employee` base class, promoting code reusability.
    * **Polymorphism:** The `calculateSalary()` method is overridden in subclasses, allowing for different salary calculations based on employee type.
    * **Abstraction:** The `Employee` class can be made abstract to define common behaviors without full implementation (though in this current structure, it might be a concrete class that can be extended).
* **Modular Design:** The project is structured into logical classes, making it easy to understand and maintain.

🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Java
* **Development Environment:** Any Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code with Java extensions)
* **JDK:** A compatible Java Development Kit is required.

📁 Project Structure

* `Employee_Payroll_System/`: The root directory of the project.
* `src/`: Contains all the source code.
* `com.employee/`: The package where all Java classes reside.
    * `Employee.java`: The base class for all employees.
    * `FullTimeEmployee.java`: Represents a full-time employee, inheriting from `Employee`.
    * `PartTimeEmployee.java`: Represents a part-time employee, inheriting from `Employee`.
    * `Main.java`: The entry point of the application, demonstrating how to use the payroll system.
    * `PayrollSystem.java`: Manages the collection of employees and handles payroll calculations.

🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have a JDK installed on your system. Most modern IDEs can help manage this for you.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Prajaktapatil31/Employee_Payroll_System.git
    cd Employee_Payroll_System
    ```

2.  **Import into your IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code):**
    * **For Eclipse:** Open Eclipse, go to `File` > `Import...` > `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace`. Browse to the cloned `Employee_Payroll_System` directory and click `Finish`.
    * **For other IDEs:** Most IDEs allow you to open a Java project directly by selecting the root `Employee_Payroll_System` folder. Ensure your IDE automatically detects or prompts you to configure the necessary JDK.

3.  **Ensure JDK is configured:** Your IDE should typically handle this automatically upon import. If you encounter any build errors, check your project's build path settings to ensure a compatible JDK is selected.

### How to Run

1.  **Locate `Main.java`:** Find `Main.java` inside the `src/com.employee/` package within your IDE.
2.  **Run the application:** Right-click on `Main.java` and select the option to `Run As` > `Java Application` (or similar, depending on your IDE).

    You should see output in your console demonstrating the creation of employees and their payroll calculations.
